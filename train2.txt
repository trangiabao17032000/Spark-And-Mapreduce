Here are two reasons companies fail: they only do more of the same, or they only do what's new
To me the real, real solution to quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities: exploration and exploitation
 Both are necessary, but it can be too much of a good thing
Consider Facit
 I'm actually old enough to remember them
 Facit was a fantastic company
 Everybody used them
 Everybody used
 And what did Facit do when the electronic calculator came along? They continued doing exactly the same
 In six months, they went from maximum revenue 
 and they were gone
 Gone
To me, the irony about the Facit story is hearing about the Facit engineers, who had bought cheap, small electronic calculators in Japan that they used to double-check their calculators
Facit did too much exploitation
 But exploration can go wild, too
 Let's call them OncoSearch
 The company was brilliant
 They had applications that promised to diagnose, even cure, certain forms of blood cancer
 They were extremely innovative, and the mantra was, "When we only get it right," or even, "We want it perfect
" The sad thing is, before they became perfect -- even good enough -- they became obsolete
 OncoSearch did too much exploration
 And to me the power of the idea is its practicality
Exploration
 Exploration is about coming up with what's new
